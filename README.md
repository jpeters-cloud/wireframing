# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating low-fidelity visual representations (blueprints or sketches) of a user interface. These wireframes outline the basic layout, structure, and functionality of a product — such as a website, app, or software interface — without focusing on design details like colors, fonts, or images.

Wireframes serve as a guide for designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand how users will interact with a product and how content and features will be arranged on each screen or page.

## Why is Wireframing Important in the Design Process?

Wireframing plays a crucial role in early-stage product development. Here are some key reasons why it’s important:

- **Clarifies Layout and Navigation:** Helps visualize the structure of the interface and how users will move through it.
- **Improves Communication:** Provides a shared reference point for team members and stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings.
- **Encourages Early Feedback:** Allows for usability testing and revisions before any code or high-fidelity design work begins.
- **Saves Time and Resources:** Identifying design or logic flaws early avoids costly changes later in the development process.
- **Supports Iterative Design:** Wireframes make it easier to prototype and refine ideas quickly and collaboratively.
